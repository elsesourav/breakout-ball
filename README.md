# Technical Challenges and Optimizations

-  ### Developing Breakout Ball involved overcoming several technical challenges to ensure smooth gameplay and efficient performance:

WebAssembly and C++: Implementing the game logic in C++ and compiling it to WebAssembly provided significant performance benefits compared to pure JavaScript. However, integrating WebAssembly with JavaScript required careful optimization to minimize overhead and ensure seamless execution.
Collision Detection: Implementing efficient collision detection algorithms for block collisions was crucial for responsive gameplay and realistic physics. Utilizing techniques like AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection helped optimize performance while maintaining accuracy.
Gameplay Optimization: Fine-tuning game mechanics such as ball movement speed, paddle responsiveness, and block layout was essential for balanced and enjoyable gameplay. Iterative testing and optimization were conducted to achieve optimal difficulty progression and player engagement.
